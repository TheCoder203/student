# Personal Blog

## Comparison to the Beginning

At the beginning of this year, I didn't knwo how to code in Javascript. I did have previous experiences with python but javascript was new. Throughout this trimester, I think that I have truly grown as I've learned many things. It's not just coding either. I've learned how to coordinate and work well in a group, split up work, and many other things that I know will come in handy for the rest of my life.

## Sprints

### Sprint 1: Onborading and LxD

In this sprint, we set up multiple tools such as Github, VsCode, and Kasm. We learned how to use each of them and what we can do with them. Below, I have put a blog that I made on Kasm setup.

#### Kasm Setup

Open Terminal > Linux Commands

Useful commands and notes:

- mkdir, cd, ls
- Clone project: git clone https://_____
- Activate tools: Ruby, Python, Git SDLC
- Workflow: code -> make -> test -> commit

Useful commands (simple list):

- ls
- pwd
- mkdir
- cd
- git
- cat
- git clone
- git pull
- git commit
- git push

KASM setup commands (for first time set up):

```bash
mkdir opencs
cd opencs
git clone https://github.com/Open-Coding-Society/student.git
cd student/
./scripts/activate.sh  # prompts for Git UID and Personal Email
./scripts/venv.sh
code .  # Opens VS Code
```

Version check commands:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
ruby -v
bundle -v
gem --version
git config --global --list
```

Starting commands for each time you open Kasm:

```bash
cd opencs/student
source venv/bin/activate  # activate Python virtual environment
code .
```

### Sprint 2: JavaScript Student Teaching

In this sprint, each group taught two lessons about JavaScript to the rest of the class. Here are all the lessons that were taught:

1. Variables (Tinkerers)
2. Functions (Tinkerers)
3. Strings (Makers)
4. Arrays (Coders)
5. Booleans (Coders)
6. Math Expressions (Penguins)
7. Data Abstraction (Penguins)
8. Classes and Methods (Constellators)
9. Conditionals (Constellators)
10. Iterations (Inventors)
11. Classes and Variables (Inventors)
12. Classes and Constructors (Makers)

My group did Functions and Variables — I co-created the variables lesson. I designed the homework and checked the lesson to make sure it matched.

Throughout each lesson, I learned and understood each aspect of coding. I later used this in our mansion game to help optimize and make the coding experience easier.

## Sprint 3: Creating a Game for N@TM

In this sprint, we, as a class, collectively made a game together with each group handling one level. Our group handled level 6, the final level. Below is a link to a blog that describes what we did:

### Mansion Game Contributions

Regarding the mansion game, I did several things to progress the level. Firstly, I added a lot of the sprite images, including all of the reaper sprites and the scythe. I also worked on the blog, which helped track our progress and showed us how far along we were. Finally, I added the easter egg of the chairs not letting you sit on them in the intro chamber.

### N@TM

For N@TM, I had two jobs. The first of these was to explain what the sprites in the intro chamber of our level did. The second job was to explain how to boss worked and its different stages during the battle.

## Hacks

I was in subteam 2 for our group, which had me, Samarth, and Pranay. We worked on Calculator and Tic-tac-toe. My main contribution was in The Calculator hack. For this hack, I worked on several things. First, I helped change to color of the buttons and also added a few more buttons to the hack.
