<details>
<summary>Sprints</summary>

## Sprint 1: Onborading and LxD

<p>In this sprint, we set up multiple tools such as Github, VsCode, and Kasm. We learned how to use each of them and what we can do with them. Below, I have put a blog that I made on Kasm setup</p>
<details>
<summary>Kasm Setup</summary>
<p>
Open Terminal> Linux Commands

mkdir, cd, ls Clone Project

git clone https://_____

 Activate Tools

Ruby, Python, Git SDLC

code->make->test->commit

Useful Commands:
Ls
Pwd
Mkdir
Cd
Git
Cat
Git clone
Git pull
Git commit
Git push

### KASM setup commands (for first time set up):  
mkdir opencs  
cd opencs  
git clone https://github.com/Open-Coding-Society/student.git
cd student/  
./scripts/activate.sh  (prompts for Git UID and Personal Email, so put that in then click enter)  
./scripts/venv.sh  
code . (Opens vscode) 

### Version check commands:  
python --version  
pip --version  
ruby -v  
bundle -v  
gem --version  
git config --global --list  

### Starting commands for each time you open Kasm:  
cd opencs/student  
source venv/bin/activate # (activate Python virtual environment  )
code .

## Sprint 2: JavaScript Student Teaching

<p>In this Sprint, each group taught 2 lessons about javascript to the rest of the class. Here are all the lessons that were taught: </p>

<p>
<details>
<summary>JS Lessons</summary>

1. Variables (Tinkerers)

2. Functions (Tinkerers)

3. Strings (Makers)

4. Arrays (Coders)

5. Booleans (Coders)

6. Math Expressions (Penguins)

7. Data Abstraction (Penguins)

8. Classes and Methods (Constellators)

9. Conditionals (Constellators)

10. Iterations (Inventors) 

11. Classes and Variables (Inventors)

12. Classes and Constructors (Makers)

My group did Functions and Variables, out of which I co-created variables. I designed the homework and also checked over the lesson to make sure it matched.

Throughout each lesson, I learned and understood each aspect of coding. I later used this in our mansion game to help optimize and make the coding experience easier.

## Sprint 3: Creating a Game for N@TM

In this sprint, we, as a class, collectively made a game together with each group handling one level. Our group handled level 6, the final level. Below, there is a link to a blog that describes what we did. <https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/gamify/blogs/mansion6>

<details>
<summary>Mansion Game Contributions</summary>

<p>Regarding the mansion game, I did several things to progress the level. Firstly, I addded a lot of the sprite images, including all of the reaper sprites and the scythe. I also worked on the blog, which helped track our progress and showed us how far along we were. Finally, I also added the easter egg of the chairs not letting you sit on them in the intro chamber.
